          <h5 class="subheading">When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">So far, the only trigger I have experienced is when I run into an issue which I struggle to overcome. An example would be when working through the free code camp exercises where the task is not very well explained, and there is nothing on the hint page to help figure out what the task is asking of me. I try to accomplish the task using the code I have learnt so far but usually it is just slightly wrong and being unable to look at hints or the answer to see where I am going wrong causes me to become highly frustrated with the whole thing and wanting to move on.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I think there is definitely some merit to the Siberian North Railroad exercise, (being Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond). There are a few times in my life where I have encountered a situation where something bad or annoying has happened and my first reaction has been to just stop and walk away. It doesn't exactly represent the Siberian North Railroad exercise fully, but gives a similar outcome I think.</p>
