          <h5 class="subheading">What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I actually didn't learn all that much due to the fact that in my sales background the same message was always drummed into us, "Listening is not waiting for your turn to speak". My understanding of the chapter was that when you have a mindfulness conversation the speaker has their turn to speak and when their turn is over the listener tells the speaker what they heard them say. The person that I had a mindfulness conversation with told me he thought it was an inefficient way to communicate due to how long it took compared to a normal conversation.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I will probably continue to use the looping technique as I find it the most effective way of making sure I fully understand what someone is telling or asking me.</p>
