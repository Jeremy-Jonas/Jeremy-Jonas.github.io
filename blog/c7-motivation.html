          <h5 class="subheading">How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">My understanding of this "lens" is that we should be trying to pursue things that we enjoy doing, rather than happiness itself, because if we are doing things that we enjoy then happiness will occur naturally. So I think life through the Pleasure, Passion and Purpose Lens looks like it would be fulfilling and satisfying.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">What are your core values?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">One of my biggest core values is honesty, both in myself and in people I let into my life. Another important value for me is trustworthiness, again in myself and the people close to me. </p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">What do you stand for?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">Live and let live. Far too often I hear stories about people who spend their whole lives hating other people (even if they have never met them) just because they live different lives. I hope one day this will become a thing of the past.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">It was certainly a different experience for me, as all of these meditation activites have been. I still feel like I am not entirely getting the full benefit of these activities and will probably keep trying some of them to see if it makes any difference.</p>
