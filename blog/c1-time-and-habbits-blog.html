    <h1>Time and Habbits</h1>
    
    <h3>18 August 2018</h3>
    
    <p>
      The two techniques I have tried so far are the Pomodoro Technique and meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      I found a lot of the materials interesting, mostly the Seven Counterintuitive Ways to be Insanely Productive. The extremely different ways of thinking about things is something that really appeals to me and the way I think. I also found the meterials on meditation interesting and it certainly opened my eyes to how little I knew about meditation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pomodoro Technique worked well for me, I found that by taking short breaks more frequently than I ordinarily would, I was able to properly focus on what I was doing for longer overall.
    </p>
    <p>
        I will probably experiment further with meditation now that I know there are so many different ways it can be done. I would also like to try timeboxing, as this concept is something I have never really done before reading about how it works.
