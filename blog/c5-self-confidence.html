          <h5 class="subheading">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">From what I can gather from reading the chapter in the book, mindfulness and self awareness are essentially the same thing. The author of the book goes on to say that his eureka moment was realising that since mindfulness is trainable then self awareness must be too.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">What was your experience when trying one of the self awareness practices from the chapter?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I decided to try the body scan as described in the chapter. I followed through all of the instructions and found it to be a bit of a strange experience, I think I may need to try it again at some point because I didn't really feel any different afterwards and I didn't really feel like I learnt anything about my body.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I took away that idea that with mindfulness training people are able to train themselves to stop thinking that the emotions they expereince <strong>are</strong> them, but rather they are <strong>being experienced by</strong> them.</p>
