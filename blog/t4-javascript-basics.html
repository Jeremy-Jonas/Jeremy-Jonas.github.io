            <h5 class="subheading">How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h5>

            <p class="blog-body">Personally I think JavaScript looks more like CSS code than HTML code and that is about where the similarities end. JavaScript is an incredibly powerful and popular programming language which is not just limited to webpage design, it can be found in programs used for word processing and PDF viewing/editing. The main function of JavaScript on websites is to help make them a lot more interactive for users.</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">Control flow and loops</h5>

            <p class="blog-body">Control flow is the order in which things are done, generally following the left to right, top to bottom order. The exception to this order is within loops, if you have a loop in your code then as long as certain conditions are met, the program will run inside the loop within the main code. Imagine this concept being like a day of your life if you are a baker. You get up (way too early) in the morning, drive to work and then start baking. So far you have followed a "control flow". Once at work you start baking, you are making cookies today and you need to stir the mixture in the bowl. Obviously to make good cookies you need to stir it more than once, so the repetitive action of stirring is comparable to a "loop" within the code. Once certain conditions are met (the cookie batter is combined properly) you exit the loop and continue with the next steps (the rest of the main code).</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h5>

            <p class="blog-body">The main difference batween accessing data from an array over an object is that you need to specify which specific piece of data you want from the array. You could think of the array as being a numbered list of items, and you need to include instructions in your code as to which list it should be looking at first, and then the number(s) of the specific item(s) you want from that list.</p>

            <h5 class="subheading">Functions</h5>

            <p class="blog-body">A function is sort of like a miniature code within the main code. Functions usually exist within the main code and can be "called" at any time from anywhere within that main code. Functions are often used to deal with variables, an example would be you have a question at the start of your code "Is it AM or PM?" You would then have the program read the time and depending on whether it was AM or PM jump to the appropriate function (AM or PM) and follow the code there. You can have multiple points within your code which ask this question and will jump to the appropriate place depending on the answer. The use of functions allows the code to remain as short as possible by not having the same basic steps repeated every time you want to ask the same question within your code.</p>
