          <h5 class="subheading">How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>  

          <p class="blog-body">The process over product concept meant that when I discovered that the skeleton framework worked slightly differently to how I expected, I would not easily be able to get my site to look exactly how I designed it in my wireframe drawings. I decided to adapt the layout to work with what skeleton was designed to do rather than spending a very long time trying to find out how to modify the code to get the site content to exactly resemble the drawings.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I was still quite unaware of the whole process of meditation and didn't really think much of it. I had mostly written it off as someting that was unlikely to work for me.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I have learnt that meditation is mostly about focusing on your breathing, being aware of when you have stopped focusing on breathing and bringing your focus back to breathing. I also learnt that losing focus on your breathing is normal and the process of realising this and bringing your focus back is what helps you strengthen your concentration.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">To be honest, not really. The techniques sugested in the chapter were all much or a muchness to me. I suppose one thing I found interesting was the mention of the fact that some people find themselves falling alseep when meditating just due to having their eyes closed. This made me slightly jealous as it has always taken me a long time to fall asleep at the end of a day.</p>
