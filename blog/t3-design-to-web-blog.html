          <p class="blog-body">A responsive site is one which is able to be easily viewed on any device, no matter the screen size. You can easily tell whether a website is responsive or not when you view it on a mobile phone browser. If the site looks exactly the same as it does on a desktop browser (meaning the text, images and links will likely be very hard to read and navigate with) then it is not responsive. Responsiveness is extremely important in this day and age because more and more people are viewing websites on mobile, and if they visit a non responsive site then there is a good chance they will quickly leave.</p>

          <p class="blog-body">Mobile first design is the concept of starting with designing the mobile friendly version of your website, and once you have a functioning and easy to view/use design, adding more features to the desktop version of the site. This concept is becoming more and more common due to the fact that mobile web usage has now surpassed desktop web usage (in fact this happened in 2016).</p>

          <p class="blog-body">A framework in web development is basically a pre written code which has been shared by the author and permission granted for anyone to use this code in their own website. Generally frameworks are designed to be used alongside your own extra design features and will often be customised by the person building the website.</p>
          
          <p class="blog-body">There are lots of styles of wireframe but all aim to accomplish the same task, and that is to provide a visual plan or blueprint of what the desired website looks like. Here are some examples of the wireframe images created for this website.</p>

          <p class="blog-body">You will notice that the site layout is actually different to how the wireframes look. This is due to how the skeleton framework (used to help create this site) didn't work exactly how I expected it to, so I needed to rearrange the menu button position on the screen to get the site to still flow in a logical direction when viewed on mobile.</p>
