          <p class="blog-body">The first thing to know is that there are 2 types of scope, <strong>Global</strong> and <strong>Local</strong>. Scopes contain variables and all variables need names, your variable can have any word as the name but cannot include a space or a few specific words which are reserved by JavaScript. The main difference between a Global scope and a Local scope is what can access the variables within. A Global scope, it should come as no surprise, can be accessed globally (within the JavaScript code document). One way to look at this would be if you think of a Global scope as the internet, anyone in the world can access the content of the internet, if the have an internet connection of course. Think of a Local scope being the intranet at a local company, anyone within that company can access anything on the local intranet, as well as stuff on the internet. The Local scope has like a 1-way valve around it, you can be inside the Local scope and get stuff from outside, but you can’t be outside the Local scope and get stuff from inside it.</p>
