          <h5 class="subheading">What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I have experience both compassionate and non-compassionate leaders in my life, usually in the form of a team leader or a manager at a job. My experience with compassionate leaders was far more pleasant and resulted in a better work life for myself and the person leading me.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">Another interesting experience, and again not really sure I took as much away from the experience as the author of the book would have expected me to.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">I found it to be a similar experience to my experience with the multiplying goodness method above. I can see what the method is trying to accomplish from reading the summary in the book but my experience was really not anything like this description.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">The SCARF model stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness and Fairness. I think a lot of the principles within each haven't really applied to my study so far due to the fact that I have been working alone at home on it. I can see that the principles will become a lot more important when I begin bootcamp and am working as part of a team of my peers.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">This blog was quite well timed actually as I did in fact need to have a difficult conversation on the day before writing it. I can't publish the specific details in this case but the outcome was one that was a slight compromise by both of us which we agreed upon after quite some time. Looking back I am satisfied with how the conversation went, everything that I needed to say was said and I believe the same to be true for the other person involved.</p>
