    <h3>26 August 2018</h3>
    
    <h2 class="subheading">What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h2>

    <p>
      I found the whole concept to be very different from anything I have thougth about before. I learned that you can potentially change your life by spending two minutes just being.

    <h2 class="subheading">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h2>

    <p>
      I found it difficult to totally switch off from everything, even though I was focused on just breathing I still had other thoughts in my head, so I may need to try this again and see if I am able to just stop thinking about everything.
