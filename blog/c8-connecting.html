          <h5 class="subheading">Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">At the time of reading the chapter, no, not really. I am sure that this will become a part of my days when starting study at Dev Academy next week though.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">Although it was not called empathic listening, I learned this technique back when I was receiving sales training at my previous sales job. When put into practice, although I never had a customer start crying because I actually listened to them, I did find that the sales I made ran more smoothly and I was able to convert a higher number of potential buyers over to satisfied customers.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">As with all of the previous meditation experiences from this book, it was something completely new and different to me. I am not really sure whether I felt much different after completing the exercise so I will have to try it again a few times and see if anything changes.</p>
          
          <h5 class="subheading">Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">A difficult situation from my past arose in my previous sales job, I was asked to cover breaks for other staff members in different roles which took me away from my role and put me in a position where I was outside of my comfort zone. <br>
            From my point of view, I found that the team leader who was making this request of me to leave my role for up to 2 hours every day was making a poor choice and potentially hurting sales as nobody was around to do my role while I was covering breaks.<br>
            From the team leader’s point of view, she was using a staff member who appeared to just wander around the shop talking to people to fill a position that really did need to be covered while the regular staff member was taking their break.
