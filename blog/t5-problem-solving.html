          <h5 class="subheading">A Problem I Experienced</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">During the fifth sprint study I became blocked on how to accomplish the task set by one of the instructions. Despite knowing what the end result needed to be, I was blocked on just exactly how to write the code that would perform this task and provide the correct end result. I tried Googling a few of the specific commands that I knew I needed to use in the code, and I tried just adding the code that I thought would work but did not get the correct result. I felt a bit tense throughout the process as I was pleased with the progress I had made already that day, and it felt like I had just run face first into a brick wall. In the end I asked for help from my peers who have done the course previously and was given a copy of the working code to examine. As soon as I saw it I had an "ahhh of course!" moment and was able to complete the task.</p>

          <h5 class="subheading">Techniques</h5>

          <p class="blog-body">
            <ul class="blog-body">
              <li><strong>Pseudocode -</strong> I haven't really used much of this myself but after looking at code that incorporates it I will definitely be trying to include it in all my code going forward.</li>
              <li><strong>Trying something -</strong> I feel confident to use this method, I have always enjoyed trying new functions in coding to see how they work out.</li>
              <li><strong>Rubber ducky method -</strong> I actually had to google this one because I had never heard of it. I have also never tried it but I can see how it could be useful and will likely try it for myself.</li>
              <li><strong>Reading error messages -</strong> I feel confident when reading error messages that I will be able to make sense of them to try and figure out what is causing them.</li>
              <li><strong>Console.logging -</strong> I did use a bit of console.logging while trying to figure out the answer to my problem described above, It did help me see what was going on within the program and helped steer me in the right direction.</li>
              <li><strong>Googling -</strong> My first method for getting an answer to a problem I am having, and my personal favourite method due to the success rate I have had when using it.</li>
              <li><strong>Asking your peers for help -</strong> Possibly my new second favourite method after sprint 5! Usually I'd rather Google it, but after the experience I had when asking peers for help during sprint 5 I will probably be doing this more.</li>
              <li><strong>Asking coaches for help -</strong> I have not yet had to, but I imagine that will be coming durint the next sprints and definitely during bootcamp. I feel confident I would be happy to ask a tutor for help.</li>
              <li><strong>Improving your process with reflection -</strong> I use this method all the time, part of every project I have done over the last few years has been finalising by looking back at what I could have done differently and learning from any mistakes I made.</li>
