    <h1>My reflections based on Shareef's Fireside Chat video</h1>
    
    <h3>18 August 2018</h3>
    
    <p>
      My take on the DBC/EDA experience is that it is a programme that strongly focuses on breaking away from the traditional school and university teaching methods to provide a quicker and better experience for the students where the main goal is to mould them into developers and software engineers.

      My impressions of EDA so far are all positive. I am excited to have been accepted and I can see that I will need to change my thought process to fit the learning methods within the programme, but I can see that this will be a very beneficial change for me to make.

      I can see myself engaging with this type of culture quite well, particularly when it comes to bootcamp as I have always preferred working on projects with other people. I find that the slight to large difference in personalities is enough to get past any hurdles because everyone looks at the same things differently.

      After watching the video my expectations of EDA have not changed. Jack did an excellent job of explaining the way the Academy works so what I was expecting from the programme before and after watching the video has not changed.

      I am very excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. It is similar at the moment to a previous Diploma I completed where the learning was self directed and I was responsible for keeping on track with the learning materials. The learning environment does not make me nervous as I can see the benefit of breaking away from the traditional styles of learning and being taught.
